NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   5 
 
1. Introduction  
In a data -driven society in which technology provides almost unlimited possibilities to collect, store, 
analyse and distribute data, the protection of personal data is of the utmost importance. Privacy is a 
fundamental right1 that now more than ever deserves protection in our society. This is the background 
of the General Data Protection Regulation which has been applied all across Europe since 25 May 
2018. 
 
Personal data protection is a top priority for a knowledge institution such as NHL Stenden. A university 
of applied sciences is indeed a real ‘data factory’. Knowledge, information and personal data are our 
operating capital.  
 
Apart from the large material and immaterial risks2  associated with careless processing of personal 
data, NHL Stenden places a very high priority on the protection of the personal data of students, staff 
and other data subjects. The correct processing of personal data by the university of applied sciences, 
also according to law, is ultimately the responsibility of the Executive Board.  
 
With the measures as described in this policy document, NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences 
gives substance to this responsibility. This  policy is aimed at the quality of the processing and 
optimizing the protection of personal data. With this policy and its correct implementation, NHL 
Stenden complies with the privacy legislation.  
1.1. Definitions  
 
GDPR : General Data Protection Regulation3.  
 
Policy: this policy with regard to the processing of personal data by NHL Stenden.  
 
Data subject: an individual and natural person to whom personal data is related. NHL Stenden 
distinguishes the following categories of data subjects: permanent employees, temporary employees, 
students, course participants, leads, alumni, external relations, guests of the Stenden Hotel and 
research subjects.  
 
Controller: the Executive Board of NHL Stenden that determines the purpose and resources for 
processing personal data . 
 
Personal data: all information about an identified or identifiable natural person.  
 
Processor : a (third) party engaged by NHL Stenden to process personal data on behalf of NHL 
Stenden and on the basis of written instructions.  
 
Processing: any operation or set of operations with regard to personal data, including collecting, 
recording, organising, storing, consulting, updating, restriction , deleting or destroying data.  
 
Third party : everyone else - not being the data subject, the controller or the proces sor, or any person 
who falls under the direct authority of the controller or the processor, who is authorised to process 
personal data.  
                                                      
1 See Article 9 of the Constitution and Article 12 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  
2 As is appropriate to the nature of the offence the maximum penalties are 10 or 20 million euros or, if 
this is greater, respectively 2 or 4% of the annual turnover. However, it is expected that reputational 
damage due to a scandal of any magnitude for an Institute for Higher Education, for which the 
financing is dependent on the student intake, is possibly even worse.  
3 The General Data Protection Regulation entered into force on 25 May 2016 and came  into effect on 25 May 
2018.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   6 
 
Data breach : a breach of security of personal data, which leads to any improper processing thereof. 
This includes both intentional as well as unintentional data breaches.  
 
Privacy by Default : data processing for which the standard settings of products and services are set 
up so that the privacy of data subjects is as far as possible guaranteed. This means, among other 
things, that as little data as possible is requested and processed.  
 
Privacy by Design: The management of the complete lifecycle of personal data, from the collection 
through to the processing and deletion, for which mechanisms are designed so that as far as  possible 
they observe the privacy of data subjects. Systematic attention is given to all -embracing guarantees 
with regard to accuracy, confidentiality, integrity, physical security and deletion of the personal data.  
 
Data Protection Impact Assessment : An assessment which helps to identify privacy risks and 
provides the tools to reduce these risks to an acceptable level.  
 
Profiling : every form of automated processing of personal data for which, on the basis of personal 
data, specific personal aspects about a natural person are evaluated, in particular with the intention of 
analysing or predicting their professional performance, economic situation, health, personal 
preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.  
 
Minors : every person who is younger than 16 years of age.  
1.2. Scope and purpose of the Policy  
 
The policy concerns the processing of personal data of all data subjects within NHL Stenden, which at 
least includes all employees (including hired and outsourced staff), students, guest s, visitors and 
external relations, as well as other data subjects of whom NHL Stenden processes personal data.  
 
This policy puts the emphasis on the fully or partially automated/systematic processing of personal 
data that takes place under the responsibil ity of NHL Stenden as well as on the underlying documents 
that are contained in a file. The policy is also applicable to the non -automated processing of personal 
data that is included in a file or that is intended to be included therein.  
 
NHL Stenden adopt s a broad interpretation of the protection of personal data. There is an important 
relationship and partial overlap with the related policy area of information security, which concerns the 
availability, integrity and the confidentiality of data, including personal data. On a strategic level 
attention is given to these overlapping areas and both planned as well as substantive coordination is 
sought.  
NHL Stenden's policy aims to optimize the quality of processing and the protection of personal data 
ensuring a good balance between privacy, functionality and security.  
 
The intention is to respect as far as possible the personal privacy of the data subject. The data which 
is related to a data subject needs to be protected against unlawful and unauthorised use, o r misuse on 
the basis of the fundamental right to protection of their personal data. This entails that the processing 
of personal data must comply with relevant legislation and that the personal data is secure at NHL 
Stenden.  
 
This Policy has the followin g objectives:  
 Provision of a framework: the Policy provides a framework to monitor the (future) processing of 
personal data against a specified ‘best practice’ or standard; and to organise the tasks, powers 
and responsibilities within the organisation.  
 Setting standards: the basis for the protection of personal data is ISO 270012. Measures are 
taken on the basis of ‘best practices’ in higher education and on the basis of ISO 270023.. The 
data registers (see § 6.5) provide the standard for the question of which personal data may be 
processed by whom.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   7 
 The SURF Framework of Legal Standards (Cloud) Services4 is adhered to as best practice for 
cloud services and other outsourcing contracts.  
 Taking responsibility: the Executive Board herewith establishes the ba sic principles and the 
organisation of the processing of personal data for the entire organisation/ NHL Stenden 
University of Applied Sciences.  
 Decisive implementation of the policy by making clear choices in measures and applying active 
monitoring on the execution of the policy measures.  
 Compliance with Dutch and European legislation.  
 
Along with the above specific objectives this policy paper also wishes to contribute to awareness with 
regard to privacy. Compliance with the law will only succeed if everyb ody in the organisation is aware 
of the necessity of careful processing and a good protection of personal data.

2. Policy principles for Processing personal data  
2.1. Policy principles  
 
The general policy principle is that personal data is processed in a fair and careful manner in 
accordance with the relevant legislation. In this regard, it is required to find the right balance between 
the interests of NHL Stenden to process personal data  and the interests of the data subject, who has a 
right that their personal privacy is respected and who must, as far as possible, have control of their 
own personal data.  
 
The following principles apply to satisfy the above policy principle:  
o Processing o f personal data is based on one of the legal grounds as stated in article 6 of the 
GDPR (“legitimacy”).  
o Personal data is only processed in a manner which is fair and transparent with regard to the 
Data Subject. This means that  the extent to which and in w hich way personal data is processed  
should be clear for the data subjects . Information about this must be easily accessible and 
understandable (“fair and transparent”).  
o Personal data is only processed for well -defined, explicitly described and justified purposes. It 
concerns specific and justified purposes, which are specified and described prior to 
commencement of the processing. Personal data is not further processed in a manner which is 
incompatible with the purposes for which it is obtained (“purpose limitation”).  
o During the processing of personal data, the amount and the type of data remains restricted to 
the personal data that is necessary for the specific purpose. With a view to that purpose, the 
data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive (“d ata minimisation”).  
o Processing of personal data takes place in the least intrusive manner and should be 
proportional to the intended purpose (“data minimisation”).  
o Measures will be taken to guarantee as far as possible that the personal data to be process ed is 
accurate and up to date (“accuracy”).  
o Personal data is adequately secured according to current security standards (“integrity and 
confidentiality”).  
o Personal data is not stored for longer than is necessary for the purposes of the processing. The 
applicable retention and deletion periods are observed for this purpose (“storage limitation”).  
 
   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   9 
 3. Legislation  
NHL Stenden has the following approach to deal with the relevant legislation.  
 
3.1. Higher Education and Scientific Research Act  
NHL Stenden has a quality assurance system that guarantees (among other things) the careful 
processing of data in the student administration and the study results. In addition, behaviour and 
integrity codes for (non -)scientific staff are observed and applied.  
 
3.2. General Data Protection Regulation  
With this Policy, NHL Stenden has implemented the necessary mechanisms to comply with the legal 
requirements. This includes the lawful and careful processing of personal data and the implementation 
of suitable technical and organisati onal measures against loss and the unlawful processing of data or 
personal data.  
 
3.3. Public Records Act  
NHL Stenden adheres to the provisions of the Public Records Act and the Public Records Decree on 
how to process information recorded in (digitized) docume nts, information systems, websites, etc. This 
is part of the annual external audit.  
   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   10 
4. Roles and responsibilities with regard to Processing 
personal data  
 
To handle the processing of personal data in a structured and coordinated fashion, NHL Stenden 
applies  the following division of roles.  
 
4.1. Executive Board  
The Executive Board is the controller and therefore has the final responsibility for the lawful and 
careful processing of personal data within NHL Stenden. The EB determines the policy, the measures 
and th e procedures.  
 
4.2. Portfolio holder for protection of personal data  
The portfolio holder for protection of personal data is the board member that has privacy in their 
portfolio. He is ultimately responsible for the protection of personal data within NHL Stende n. 
 
4.3. Data Protection Officer  
In accordance with Article 37 of the GDPR, NHL Stenden has appointed a ‘Data Protection Officer’ 
(hereafter: DPO). The DPO is registered with the Data Protection Authority. NHL Stenden will engage 
the DPO in a timely manner in all matters involving personal data. The DPO provides information and 
advice with regard to compliance with the privacy legislation and ensures this compliance4. The DPO 
has an independent position within the university of applied sciences.  
 
The DPO has t he following tasks. He:  
  informs and advises all the involved parties about their obligations under the GDPR;  
  ensures compliance with the GDPR and other relevant privacy legislation;  
  ensures compliance with this privacy policy by NHL Stenden;  
  ensures the execution of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs);  
  cooperates with the Data Protection Authority and is the first point of contact within the 
organisation.  
4.4. System owner  
Every application has a system owner who is responsible for ensuri ng that the system does what it 
should do and that this takes place within the frameworks of this Policy. The system owner ensures 
that the application, both now and in the future, continues to fulfil on the one hand the requirements 
and wishes of the user s and on the other hand the legislation.  
4.5. Director  
The director is responsible for compliance with this policy within his Academy, Service or Liaison Unit. 
He supports and facilitates the Data Protection Counsellor (see § 4.6). The director has the task to:  
 ensure that his employees are aware of the Policy;  
 ensure compliance with the Policy by his employees;  
 periodically discuss the topic of privacy during work meetings.  
 
                                                      
4 Article 39 of the GDPR ex plicitly mentions both roles: Providing information and advice on the one 
hand and ensuring compliance on the other.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   11 
4.6. Data Protection Counsellor  
 
The Data Protection Council at NHL Stenden is a consultativ e and advisory body with regard to 
policies on privacy (protection of personal data) and security (information security). The DPC is 
composed of representatives from all Academies, Liaison Units and departments. The members of the 
Information Security Stee ring Group are officially part of the DPC. The members of the DPC are called 
Data Protection Counsellors.    
The executive committee of the DPC is composed of the Data Protection Officer and the Security 
Officer, both of whom form a part of the Executive St aff. The meetings are led by the DPO.

An annual joint training session is part of the activities of the Data Protection Council.   
 
4.7. Privacy Off icer 
De Privacy Officer supports the Academies, departements and units in the execution of this privacy 
policy.  He does so as a member of the Star team.   
 
4.8. Employees and students  
Employees and students are not the only ones for whom personal data is proces sed and who as such 
have certain rights, but as an employee and as a student they also have their obligations where it 
concerns the processing of personal data within the framework of their work or study. Both employees 
and students must comply with this P olicy. In all cases, they need to process personal data with care 
and are obliged to immediately report possible data breaches or vulnerabilities via the data breaches 
hotline or to the Data Protection Officer.  
 
If required, there are protocols and work i nstructions available for employees within their Academy, 
Liaison Unit or department. Students are informed by NHL Stenden of their rights and obligations, 
among other things via the Students' Charter.  
 
                                                      
5 An annual joint training session is part of the activities of the Data Protection Council.   
  
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   12 
A sanction can be imposed by the EB on employees, due  to their culpable behaviour in relation to the 
processing of the personal data of colleagues, students or other data subjects.  
 
The sanctions that can be imposed on students due to culpable behaviour in relation to the processing 
of personal data of othe r students, staff or data subjects at NHL Stenden, are described in the 
Students' Charter.  
 
Paragraph 1.1 describes which other data subjects NHL Stenden distinguishes.  
   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   13 
 
5. Implementation Policy  
 
The NHL Stenden Executive Board is responsible for processing personal data for which the 
Executive Board determines the purpose and the resources. The EB is therefore the Controller in 
terms of the GDPR. The actual processing of personal data is, however,  performed at all levels at NHL 
Stenden.  
A good governance structure ensures that the university of applied sciences makes compliance with 
the privacy legislation possible and that those involved know that their personal data is processed 
carefully and within the frameworks of the law. This structure also makes it possible that those 
involved can exercise their rights (see § 8).  
 
5.1. Distribution of responsibilities  
 The careful processing of personal data needs to be regarded as a line responsibility . This 
means that directors of Academies, Services and Liaison Units bear the primary responsibility for 
the careful processing of personal data within their department. They do this within the frameworks 
agreed to within this Policy. The line responsibility also has the task of communicating the policy 
with regard to the processing of personal data to all relevant parties.  
 
 The careful processing of personal data is everyone's responsibility . It is expected from 
employees and students that they behave with integri ty. It is not acceptable that due to behaviour, 
even if not intentional, unsafe situations arise that could result in damage and/or have a negative 
impact on NHL Stenden's reputation or on that of individuals. It is for this reason that codes of 
conduct ar e formulated and implemented. Taking this responsibility is also the task of the result -
responsible teams.  
 
5.2. Incorporation in the institutional governance/ Coordination with 
related policy areas  
To clearly demonstrate the coherence within the organisation w ith regard to data protection and 
coordinate the initiatives and activities with regard to the processing of personal data within the 
various departments, it is important to have structured discussions on the topic of privacy at different 
levels.  
 
At a strategic level this involves providing guidance with regard to governance and compliance, and 
also with regard to the objectives, scope and ambition concerning privacy. The Executive Board and 
the university consultation provide substance at the strategic le vel. 
 
At the tactical level the strategy is translated into plans, the standards to be applied, and methods of 
evaluation. These plans and instruments are a guideline for the execution. The Data Protection 
Council (see § 4.6) and the management teams of th e Academies, Services and Liaison Units provide 
substance at the tactical level.  
 
Matters which concern the daily business operations (execution) are discussed at the operational 
level . The Information Security Steering Group (coordination between the exe cution of privacy and 
information security) and all result -responsible teams provide substance at the operational level.  
 
The Executive Staff advises at the strategic level, oversees the tactical level (by means of audits) and 
provides information upon re quest at the operational level.  
 
 
  
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   14 
Focused on activities which have to been performed in the domain of privacy, three levels can be 
distinguished.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3. Awareness and training  
Policy and measures are not sufficient to eliminate all risks with regard to processing personal data. It 
is necessary to continuously raise awareness at NHL Stenden in order to increase the knowledge of 
risks and to encourage safe and responsible behaviou r. A part of the policy are the regularly held 
awareness campaigns for employees, students and guests. These campaigns are in line with national 
campaigns in higher education, if possible,  in coordination with other data protection campaigns. 
Increasing aw areness is a joint responsibility of the Data Protection Officer and the Security Officer.  
5.4. Monitoring and compliance  
 
Audits make it possible to monitor the policy and the measures taken for effectiveness. From the 
Executive Staff, the DPO and the Security  Officer initiate monitoring the lawful and careful processing 
of personal data.  
 
Any external checks are carried out by independent accountants. This is linked to the annual audit and 
as far as possible is integrated into the normal Planning & Control cyc le. Peer reviews within the 
framework of the SURFaudit form part of the external audits of NHL Stenden.  
 
If compliance with the regulations on protection of data and privacy details falls seriously short, NHL 
Stenden may impose a sanction on the responsibl e employees, within the frameworks of the 
Collective Labour Agreement and the legal possibilities.

NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   15 
The processing of personal data is a continuous process. Technological and organisational 
developments inside and outside NHL Stenden make it necessary to p eriodically check whether the 
Policy is still sufficiently on the right track.  
 
   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   16 
6. Lawful and precise processing of personal data  
 
NHL Stenden processes personal data in accordance with the principles as explained in paragraph 
2.1 of this Policy. To implement these principles, NHL Stenden takes the measures as mentioned in 
this chapter.  
 
6.1. Lawfulness  
NHL Stenden only processes personal data if there are legal grounds as described in article 6 of the 
GDPR:  
a. Consent  of the Data Subject.  
b. Necessary for the performance of a contract  with the Data Subject.  
c. Necessary  for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject  
d. Necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or another natural person.  
e. Necessary for the performance  of a task carried out in the public  interest or within the framework 
of exercising public authority.  
f. Necessary for the protection of the legitimate interest s pursued by the controller or  by a third 
party.  
 
In practice it usually concerns one of the principles  written in italics, for which it should be pointed out 
that ‘ consent’  in interdependencies (such as that between an employer and an employee, or between 
a university of applied sciences and a student;) is generally not a valid principle6. The principles for the 
various processing operations are stated in the data registers (see § 6.5).  
6.2. Privacy statement  
NHL Stenden processes personal data in a way that is fair and transparent with regard to the Data 
Subject. This means that NHL Stenden provides the Data S ubject with insight into the extent and 
manner in which their personal data is processed. When collecting personal data, NHL Stenden will 
inform the Data Subject by means of a privacy statement. Information will take place prior to the 
processing, unless i n all reasonableness this is not possible. The data registers for the various 
categories include a privacy statement which is concentrated on that category. The NHL Stenden 
websites contain an overarching privacy statement. See also paragraph 8.1 of this P olicy.  
 
6.3. Retention periods  
Personal data will not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or for 
which it is used, in accordance with the detailed retention policy of NHL Stenden. NHL Stenden will 
destroy the personal data  after the expiration of the retention period or store it in an archive if the 
personal data is intended for historical, statistical or scientific purposes. The retention periods are 
stated in the data registers.  
 
6.4. Suitable data protection measures:  
NHL Ste nden is responsible for an adequate level of data protection and implements appropriate 
technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against loss or against any form of 
unlawful processing. These measures are partly focused on avoiding un necessary or unlawful 
collection and processing of personal data. NHL Stenden has implemented an internal data protection 
policy outlining the measures that NHL Stenden employees must adhere to.  
                                                      
6 Permission must be given completely freel y, you need to know exactly what you are giving 
permission for and the permission needs to be explicit.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   17 
 
A risk assessment on the protection of privacy and informat ion security forms part of the internal risk 
management and monitoring system of NHL Stenden.  
 
6.5. Obligation of documentation  
NHL Stenden has taken various measures to demonstrably comply with the legal requirements of the 
GDPR, including the implementation of this Policy.  
 
In accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR, NHL Stenden maintains a ‘ record  of processing activities’. 
NHL Stenden gives substance to this with integral, well -organised ‘data registers’ for the various 
categories of data subjects (Cuijpers method). There are data registers for:  
- students  
- course participants  
- permanent employees  
- temporary employees  
- leads  
- alumni  
- external relations  
- hotel guests (of the Stenden University Hotel).  
 
An amended form of the obligation of documentation has been designed for the last category 
‘research subjects’ (persons who are interviewed within the framework of research, varying from th e 
bachelor thesis to the research of a Professor of Applied Sciences). The DPO is involved in drawing 
up the data registers and they monitor compliance to them. For every ‘data register’ there is one 
director who has mandated responsibility (see appendix 1 0.1 for an overview).  
 
 
NHL Stenden also structurally performs Data Protection Impact Assessments (DIPAs), at least in the 
case of (larger research) projects, infrastructural changes within the information architecture or the 
purchase of new systems that a re likely to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural 
persons. If it appears from these assessments that the processing would entail a high risk if NHL 
Stenden does not take measures to limit the risk, NHL Stenden will consult the supervisory  authority 
prior to processing.  
 
The DPIAs referred to above are, where applicable, repeated after three years.  
 
A ‘quick DPIA’  is also carried out as standard procedure prior to the introduction of new apps within, 
for example, an Academy.  
 
The DPO and  the Security Officer give advice on the question of whether a DPIA is mandatory, 
recommended or is not required.  
 
6.6. Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default  
NHL Stenden applies the principles of “Privacy by Design” and “Privacy by Default” for the 
implement ation of each Processing activity.  
 
Due to the considerable material risks, the risk analysis on protection of privacy and information 
security is the subject of the audit and an annual discussion during the meeting of the Supervisory 
Board.  
  
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   18 
6.7. Confidentiality  
 
NHL Stenden  classifies all personal data as confidential. Everyone should be aware of the 
confidentiality of personal data and act accordingly.  
 
Persons who are not bound by a confidentiality obligation by virtue of office, profession or statutory 
regulations, are also obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the personal data of which they are 
aware, except to the extent that any statutory regulation obliges them to disclosure or the necessity for 
disclosure arises from their duties.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   19 
6.8. Special Personal Data  
 
The processing of special personal data is in principle prohibited, unless one of the legal exceptions of 
the GDPR applies, such as ‘explicit consent from the Data Subject’ or ‘substantial public interest’. 
Moreover, these special typ es of personal data are subject to stricter security requirements. In cases 
where basic protection is not sufficient, additional, individually tailored measures must be taken for 
each information system.  
 
Special personal data includes the following data:  
 data relating to race or ethnic origin;  
 data revealing political opinions;  
 religious or philosophical beliefs;  
 data revealing a membership of a trade union;  
 genetic data with the purpose of the unique identification of a person;  
 biometric data with the pur pose of the unique identification of a person;  
 data concerning health;  
 data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation.  
 
For two types of personal data it applies that they do not fall under the category of special personal 
data, but that the Pro cessing and protection thereof is however subject to comparable similar strict 
requirements:  
 
a) Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and criminal offences is only 
permitted under the supervision of the government or requires a lawful basis under European or 
national legislation.  
 
b) Under Dutch law, the processing of a national citizen service number (Dutch BSN or the 
individual education number) require s a lawful basis.  
 
6.9. Transfer of personal data  
6.9.1.  Outsourcing of Processing to a Processor  
 
If NHL Stenden engages a Processor  to process personal data, the execution of the Processin g shall 
be governed by a Controller -Processor Agreement, between NHL Stenden, the Controller, and the 
Processor in question.  
6.9.2.  Transfer of personal data within the European Economic Area (hereinafter ‘EEA’)  
NHL Stenden only provides personal data to a Proces sor domiciled within the EEA, if the processing 
is based on one of the principles for data processing of Articles 6 or 9 of the GDPR and if the 
Processor meets the legal requirements of the GDPR.  
6.9.3.  Transfer of personal data outside the EEA  
 
NHL Stenden only  provides personal data to Processors established in a country outside the EEA, if 
one of the following conditions is met: 
 
1. The third country, territory, specific sector in a third country or the international organisation 
in question offers an adequate le vel of protection according to the European Commission.  
 
NHL Stenden applies the following appropriate level of protection:  
 The general list of countries with an adequate level of protection, published by the 
European Commission7;  
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   20 
 The Privacy Shield for c ompanies in the United States, published by the European 
Commission in cooperation with the US Department of Commerce8. 
 
2. Transfer takes place subject to appropriate safeguards referred to in Articles 46 and 47 of 
the GDPR. Transfer of personal data to the International Branch Campuses of NHL Stenden 
takes place based on Standard European Contractual Clauses (‘Model Clauses’). These 
model clauses have been signed by all four IBCs.  
 
3. Transfer takes place subject to one of the legal exceptions of Article 49 of the GDPR. 
Pursuant to Article 30, paragraph 2a of the (Dutch) General Data Protection Regulation 
Implementation Act of 16 May 2018, NHL Stenden only transfers medical data, such as 
information on allergies or medication, of students who are going on a Gran d Tour TM, this 
with regard to their own safety, with their knowledge and only if necessary.  
6.10.  Questions and complaints procedure  
6.10.1.  Notification and registration  
Questions or complaints regarding (the processing of) personal data can be reported to the Data 
Protection Officer. A record will be kept of questions or complaints with a (potential) significant impact.  
 
All data subjects, all processors of NHL Stenden a nd all third parties may submit a complaint or a 
question.  
  
6.10.2.  Security vulnerabilities  
Employees are obliged to report any potential data breaches immediately to the Data Breach hotline 
for personal data ( https://datalekken.nhlstenden.com ). This may, for instance, concern the loss or theft 
of data carriers or mobile devices, weaknesses observed in systems or services, suspicions of 
security breaches or indications that personal data is in the wrong place.  A record is kept of all 
notifications regarding security vulnerabilities.  
6.10.3.  Processing  
Questions, complaints and security vulnerabilities are transferred to the responsible department or 
person and consequently dealt with as quickly as possible in accordan ce with the relevant procedures.  
If the personal data of Data Subject(s) or the business processes, the finances or the reputation of 
NHL Stenden are seriously threatened, at a minimum the Executive Board and the DPO will be 
informed.  
6.10.4.  Evaluation  
It is impo rtant to learn from the feedback obtained through the question and complaints procedure. 
Registration of significant questions, complaints and vulnerabilities and a periodic report thereof are 
part of a professional manner of processing personal data. The relevant reports are therefore an 
integral part of the annual report of the Executive Board and the DPO.  
 
 
6 Retention periods may be imposed by law as is the case with financial data or formal study results, 
but they may also be established by NHL Stende n, for instance in an agreement between NHL 
Stenden and the Data Subject.

7. Data Breaches  
 
This chapter describes the policy with regard to the notification, registration and processing of a Data 
Breach or a suspected Data Breach in normal business operations and in special circumstances.  
 
7.1. Data breach  
A Data Breach is a breach of security of pe rsonal data leading to any unauthorised Processing 
thereof. This may concern the theft of a laptop, a USB stick left on a train or an email sent to the 
wrong person. Data Breaches must be reported to the Data Protection Authority within 72 hours after 
discovery and in some cases also to the Data Subject, i.e . the person whose personal data has been 
leaked.  
 
7.2. Notification and registration  
 
A Data Breach may occur within the organisation of NHL Stenden, but also at a Processor, engaged 
by NHL Stenden. In this regard, the following situations should be distinguished:  
 
a. Employee : employees, if they detect a (potential) Data Breach or if they suspect to be involved in 
a Data Breach, must notify the data breaches hotline via https://datalekken.nhlstenden.com  or, in 
exceptional cases to a confidential advisor or the Data Protection Officer of NHL Stenden.  
b. Processor: it is also possible that a Data Breach occurs at the Processor engaged by NHL 
Stenden. The Processor will report the Data Breach to NHL Stenden as agreed in the Controller -
Processor Agreement.  
c. Other persons:  if anyone other than an employee or a Processor detects a (potential) Data 
Breach or is involved in a Data Breach, they must immediately notify the data breaches hotline 
via https://datalekken.nhlstenden.com  or the Data Protection Officer.  
 
7.3. Processing  
A suspicion of a data breach must be reported immediately using the appropriate online reporting 
form. This reporting form will state, among other things:  
 
- The person reporting the incident;  
- How the incident manifested itself;  
- Whether personal data is involved and if so, what kind of data and how many people it 
concerns.  
 
After such a report, a team of  specialists (the ‘triage team’) will be immediately notified by email that 
there is a potential data breach. The triage team processes the notification as quickly as possible and 
based on the Instructions of the Data Protection Authority, they determine w hether or not it concerns a 
data breach (or a simple security incident) and whether the data breach must be reported to the Data 
Protection Authority (as this is not required in all cases) and finally they determine whether the data 
subject(s) must also be  notified of the data breach. These considerations are recorded in the online 
registration system. Any notification to the Data Protection Authority and the data subjects is made by 
the Executive Board, assisted by the Data Protection Officer. In accordanc e with the law, notification 
must be made within 72 hours of discovery. Data subjects are notified by the Academy, department or 
Liaison Unit where the data breach occurred with the assistance of Corporate Communication and the 
DPO.  
  
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   22 
The triage team consists of two representatives of the Digital Learning and Working Environment 
(Operational Security Officer and Information Architect) and two representatives of the Executive Staff 
(Security Officer and DPO). In this way, the DPO has knowledge of all th e (potential) data breaches. If 
necessary, the triage team may seek assistance from a colleague from the Legal Affairs Department.  
 
The EB is informed about all data breaches identified as such, including the data breaches that have 
not been reported to th e Data Protection Authority.  
 
7.4. Decision making  
The triage team advises on whether or not a data breach must be reported to the Data Protection 
Authority and possibly also to the data subject. The decision as to whether or not to make a 
notification is taken  by the EB. The notification itself is officially made by the EB. If, contrary to the 
advice of the triage team, the EB decides not to report the data breach, the DPO will include this 
decision with the underlying considerations in his annual report.  
 
7.5. Evaluation  
It is important to learn from Data Breaches in order to reduce the likelihood of Data Breaches in the 
future. The registration of Data Breaches and a periodic report thereof are part of the professional 
manner in which personal data is processed. T he reports on Data Breaches with regard to personal 
data are therefore an integral part of the annual reports of the Executive Board and of the DPO.

8. Rights of Data Subjects  
 
Under the GDPR, Data Subjects have certain rights with which they can exercise control over the 
Processing of their personal data. A request can be submitted to the appro priate desk <link>.  
 
The following points apply to all rights of Data Subjects as described in this chapter:  
 
 Notification to Data Subject  
NHL Stenden will ensure that information and communication are provided to the Data Subject in a 
concise and accessi ble manner and in clear and simple language. The language will be attuned to the 
target group. NHL Stenden has set up a data register for each target group (category of data subjects) 
in which is recorded which personal data is processed for which reason, purpose and on which legal 
grounds. Each data register contains a privacy statement geared towards the category in question.  
 
 Period  
A Data Subject request must be replied to in writing as soon as possible and at least within four weeks 
from receipt of th e request. The Data Subject must in any event be informed of the actions taken in 
response to the request. If the period of four weeks is not reasonably feasible, the Data Subject must 
be notified accordingly within this period. In this case, NHL Stenden w ill comply with the Data Subject 
Request within two months after expiry of the first period.  
 
 Identity of the Data Subject  
When providing the relevant information, NHL Stenden must ensure that the identity of the Data 
Subject is properly verified. For this purpose, NHL Stenden may request additional information.  
 
 Minors  
A request to exercise one of the rights as described in this chapter by a Data Subject, being a Minor, 
placed under guardianship or legal custody, must be submitted by their legal repres entative. A 
response by NHL Stenden will be sent to the legal representative in question.  
 
8.1. Right to be informed  
The Data Subject has the right to be provided by NHL Stenden with information about certain aspects 
of the Processing of their personal data. N HL Stenden shall inform the Data Subject free of charge of 
the Processing of their personal data, both in the case of personal data that has been collected 
directly from the Data Subject and in the case where the data has been obtained by other means.  
 
A. Personal data collected directly from the Data Subject.  
If the personal data is collected directly from the Data Subject, NHL Stenden provides the Data 
Subject with at least the following information  prior to the collection of the data : 
- The identity and contact details of the Controller and where appropriate of the DPO.  
- The specific purpose of the Processing for which the personal data is intended as well as the legal 
grounds for the processing.  
- The legitimate interests of the Controller or Third Party if  legal grounds for the Processing is a 
‘legitimate interest’.  
- Where appropriate, the intention of the Controller to transfer personal data to a third country, which 
country it concerns and on which grounds the personal data is to be transferred.  
- The reten tion period of personal data, or if this is not possible, the criteria used to determine the 
retention period.  
- The existence of the right to request the Controller to inspect, rectify or delete personal data, limit 
the processing of personal data related t o the data subject, as well as the right to object to the 
Processing and the right to data portability.  
- The right to complain to the supervisory authority.  
- The recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   24 
- If the Processing is based on ‘con sent’, the Data Subject has the right to withdraw this consent at 
any time.  
- Whether the personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract or to comply with a legal 
obligation.  
- Whether the personal data is also used for automated decision makin g. The underlying logic, as 
well as the importance and the expected consequences of the Processing for the Data Subject 
must also be reported.  
 
B. Personal data collected from another source than the Data Subject  
If the personal data is not collected directly  from the Data Subject but from another source, the Data 
Subject shall be provided with the following information in addition to the above -mentioned points:  
- The categories of personal data.  
- The source from which the personal data is obtained.  
  
The above information is recorded at NHL Stenden in the data registers and insofar it concerns 
research, in the SmartPIA package.  
 
The data registers are accessible to all categories of data subjects from the first contact with NHL 
Stenden. Students, course particip ants and staff members are actively informed of the data registers 
at the beginning of their study or at the commencement of their employment contract.  
 
8.2. Right of access  
 
 Request  
Every Data Subject has the right to request information as to whether their personal data is being 
processed and if that is the case, the Data Subject has the right to access their personal data.  
 
 Notification  
When providing access to the data register, N HL Stenden provides the data subject with the following 
information:  
- A description of the purposes of the Processing.  
- The categories of data to which Processing is related.  
- Categories of recipients.  
- Available information about the origin of the personal da ta. 
- The retention period for personal data or, if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine this 
period.  
- The Data Subject's right to request the Controller for rectification or erasure of personal data, the 
right to restrict or object to the Pro cessing as well as the right to data portability.  
- The Data Subject's right to make a complaint to a supervisory authority.  
- All available information about the source of the data, if the data is not collected from the Data 
Subject.  
- The appropriate safegu ards put in place, if the personal data is transferred to a third country.  
 
 Copy  
The Data Subject can request a copy of all the personal data. This copy must be provided in a 
standard electronic format, unless the request is made on paper or if the Data S ubject explicit ly 
requests a paper copy.  
 
 Costs  
Every first copy can be requested free of charge. However, for any additional copy NHL Stenden will 
charge the Data Subject €15 for administrative costs.  
 
 Rights and freedoms of others  
When providing the pers onal data, NHL Stenden will take into account the rights and freedoms of 
others.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   25 
 
8.3. Right to data portability  
 Grounds for request  
Any Data Subject may submit a request to NHL Stenden to obtain (free of charge) their personal data 
in a structured, commonly used and machine -readable format or to enable them to easily transfer their 
personal data to another Controller (data portability), without being hindered by NHL Stenden, 
provided the following conditions are met:  
1. The Processing by NHL Stenden is based on ‘consent’ or ‘execution of a contract with the Data 
Subject’.  
2. The Processing in question is fully automated.  
 
 Rights and freedoms of others  
 
When providing the personal data, NHL Stenden will take into account the rights and freedoms of 
others.  
 
 Erasure o f personal data  
If a Data Subject has exercised their right of data portability in the context of a Processing activity for 
the execution of a contract, NHL Stenden may not decide to erase the data. However, after expiry of 
the retention period, NHL Stende n must then erase the data.  
 
If the right is exercised within the context of Processing based on the consent of the Data Subject, 
NHL Stenden may decide to erase the data after the right has been exercised.  
  
8.4. Right to rectification, completion, erasure o r restriction of the 
Processing.  
 
 Request for rectification, completion, erasure or restriction  
Every Data Subject may request that personal data stored at NHL Stenden is rectified, supplemented, 
deleted or that the Processing is restricted. In the event of the right to restriction, the personal data is 
temporarily restricted  and is no longer process ed by NHL Stenden. The restriction will be clearly 
indicated in the file.  
 
 Notification  
If it appears that the recorded personal data of the Data Subject is factually incorrect, that it is 
incomplete or irrelevant for the purposes of the Processing or has  otherwise been processed contrary 
to statutory regulations, the data manager (the functional data manager or the Processor) will correct, 
permanently delete, supplement or limit this data.  
 
Moreover, Third Parties who have been provided with data prior t o the rectification, supplementation, 
erasure or restriction, are notified unless this is reasonably impossible or given the circumstances 
irrelevant. The Data Subject may request NHL Stenden to provide information as to whom NHL 
Stenden has made this noti fication.  
 
 Execution period  
The data manager ensures that a decision to correct, supplement, erase or restrict  is executed as 
soon as possible. The execution of this will take place without any charge to the Data Subject.  
 
  
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   26 
8.5. Right to object  
 
 Grounds for objection  
There are two grounds for the Data Subject to object to Processing:  
 
1. In relation to their private circumstances, any Data Subject may object to Processing by NHL 
Stenden if this Processing takes place on the basis of promoting the legitimate inte rest of NHL 
Stenden or a Third Party to whom the data is provided. See paragraph 6.1 for a description of the 
grounds.  
 
In the event of objection, NHL Stenden will, in principle, cease the Processing. If NHL Stenden can 
prove that its compelling legitimat e interests outweigh the interests or the fundamental right and 
freedoms of the Data Subject, the Processing will continue. If the objection is justified, NHL 
Stenden will (free of charge) take the necessary measures to cease processing the personal data 
for the purposes in question.  
 
2. With regard to Processing for ‘direct marketing’ purposes, the data subject has the right to object at 
any time. In case of an objection, NHL Stenden will immediately cease the processing for direct 
marketing purposes (free o f charge) and not resume the processing.  
  
8.6. Automated decision -making  
Grounds  
Data subjects have the right not be subjected to a decision solely based on automated Processing, 
which may have legal consequences for them. A ‘decision based on an automated Pr ocessing’ means 
a decision made without human intervention. This includes Profiling.  
 
NHL Stenden never takes decisions about individuals solely based on automated processing 
of personal data.  
8.7. Legal protection  
 
 General complaints  
If the Data Subject is of the opinion that the legal provisions relating to the protection of privacy or the 
provisions of this regulation are not enforced correctly, they may complain in writing to the Data 
Protection Officer: fg@nhlstenden.com . A complaint about the Data Protection Officer can be 
submitted to the confidential counsellor or to the Data Protection Authority.  
 
 Other provisions for appeal  
In addition to the general internal complaints procedure as desc ribed above, the Data Subject has the 
following possibilities if they feel that NHL Stenden has committed a violation of the GDPR that affects 
them.  
 
A. Appeals procedure at the Subdistrict Court  
If NHL Stenden has taken a negative decision on a request as d escribed in paragraphs 8.1 to 8.6 of 
this Policy, or if NHL Stenden has rejected the request of the Data Subject, the Data Subject has the 
option to start an appeals procedure at the Subdistrict Court.  
 
The appeal must be submitted to the Subdistrict Court  within six weeks after receipt of the reply from 
NHL Stenden. If NHL Stenden has not replied to the Data Subject's request within the stipulated 
period, the appeal must be submitted within six weeks of expiry of this period. The appeal does not 
need to be  submitted by a lawyer.  
 
B. Objection and appeal   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   27 
If NHL Stenden has made a negative decision with regard to a request as described in paragraphs 8.1 
to 8.6 of this Policy, or if NHL Stenden has rejected the request of the Data Subject, and the decision 
of NHL  Stenden can be considered to be a decision by an administrative body within the meaning of 
Article 6 paragraph 4 of the General Administrative Law Act, the Data Subject has the option to start 
an objection procedure. An objection procedure must always be started within 6 weeks of the 
publication of a decision from NHL Stenden. An appeal may be lodged with the court against a 
decision on objection.  
 
C. Request for enforcement to a supervisory authority  
If NHL Stenden has made a negative decision with regard t o a request as described in paragraphs 8.1 
to 8.6 of this Policy, or if NHL Stenden has rejected the request of the Data Subject , the Data Subject 
has the option to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or to have an organisation 
representing thei r interests act on their behalf.  
   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   28

10. Appendices  
10.1.  The data registers: which personal data, where and why?  
Article 30 of the GDPR obliges us to draw up and maintain a ‘register of processing activities’. This 
enables an organisation to demonstrate which personal data is processed under its responsibility. 
NHL Stend en provides substance to this obligation with a data register7 for each target group (in the 
terms of the GDPR: ‘category of data subjects’).  
 
NHL Stenden has drawn up data registers for the following groups. The mandated responsible 
directors are shown between parentheses (situation as of November 2018).  
 
- Students (Angela Schat)  
- Course participants (Soon Hee Santema)  
- Leads (Rob Koning)  
- Alumni (Rob Koning)  
- Permanent employees (Alette Hospers)  
- Temporary employees (Alette Hospers)  
- External relations (Rob Ko ning)  
- Guests of the Stenden University Hotel (Thulani Xhali)  
The EB has appointed a mandated responsible person for each data register, a director who is 
responsible for compliance and maintenance of the data register. Their names are given above 
between p arentheses8. 
 
The data register is essentially a matrix in which an exhaustive list of the processed personal data is 
set off against the locations where this personal data ‘resides’: at external controllers, such as the Tax 
Authorities, at processors such  as Youforce Raet and at the various organisational units of NHL 
Stenden.  
 
The compliance of the data registers is part of the privacy audit carried out by the Executive Staff, 
which takes place twice  a year. Furthermore, the data registers are an express  subject of debate in 
the reporting discussions with all directors.  
 
Within their Academy, Service or Liaison Unit, the members of the Data Protection Council have a 
monitoring and informing task where it concerns the data registers.  
 
All data registers can be found via https://privacy.nhlstenden.com/   
10.2.  Procedure 'How can data subjects exercise their rights?'  
Data subjects who want to exercise their rights can apply to an online desk for this purpose9. If it 
concerns a request for inspection, they will receive the data register applicable to them by return. If the 
data subject wants to know more than which of their data is processed and with other requests, a 
meeting will take place within two weeks wi th a representative of the Data Protection Council10. The 
data subject must be able to identify themselves during this conversation. The purpose of the 
conversation is two -fold: de -escalation and specification. If it is then clear what the data subject 
exac tly wants, the request (for example a request for inspection) is sent to the mandated person 
responsible for the data register in question. They ensure that the data subject is able to exercise their 
                                                      
7 The instrument is developed under the direction of Ludo Cuijpers of Leeuwenborg Opleidingen and is 
also used, among others, at Fontys University of Ap plied Science s and the Open University. The Data 
Protection Authority has praised the instrument.

rights within four weeks and, in this example, are able to inspect their data. See Chapter 8 for the 
rights of the data subject.  
 
Requests for erasure of leads and alumni are granted without further investigation on the basis of a 
check of the e -mail address.  
 
All requests and also their settlement are documen ted and stored for a period of two years in a central 
register.  
 
Data subjects who are not satisfied about the manner in which their request is dealt with, can contact 
the DPO. The DPO monitors the existence, the organisation and the operation of this proc edure.  
 
10.3.  Procedure Data Protection Impact Assessments  
A Data Protection Impact Assessment is a systematic assessment of the necessity and the risks of the 
(intended) processing of personal data. The GDPR requires the DPIA particularly if it concerns:  
a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is 
based on automated processing (…)   
b) processing on a large scale of special categories of data (…)  
c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a l arge scale.11 
 
The requirements of the Data Protection Authority appear to imply a broader use of the DPIA. A DPIA 
is always recommendable and provides useful information for the data regis ter, for any Controller -
Processo r Agreement that needs to be entered  into and for the required level of information security.  
 
The DPIA is therefore carried out within NHL Stenden  
 for all large, essential processing of personal data (repeated every three years)  
 for all new systems or processes  
 for all apps and other digita l applications deployed at an Academy or at a departmental level  
 for research projects in which personal data is processed, a DPIA will be carried out if one or 
more of the following criteria are applicable.  
o international;  
o cooperation with other institu tions;  
o processing of special personal data;  
o processing data of more than 1000 respondents;  
o master or PhD research.  
 
The initiative for a DPIA is taken by the system owner and/or manager and/or main researcher. The 
execution takes place under the direction of the Security Officer. The results are documented, just as 
following -up on the resulting recommendations.  
 
Monitoring the compliance of the execution of a DPIA forms part of the privacy audit that is carried out 
twice a year. The topic is put o n the agenda in the report discussions which the directors hold with the 
EB. Within the Academy, Service or Liaison Unit the members of the DPC have a monitoring and 
informing role where it concerns the DPIAs. The reporting about the execution of the DPIAs  is part of 
the annual report of the DPO.  
 
Each year, a general information meeting is held with regard to the instrument of the DPIA.

NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   31 
10.4.  Procedure Privacy by design  
‘Data protection by design ( privacy by design ) implies that the mechanisms used for processing are so 
designed that they take into account as far as possible the privacy of the data subjects and the 
requirements from the GDPR. A system that satisfies this could therefore, for example, have buttons 
incorporated with which data subjects cou ld inspect their personal data. This includes other measures 
focused, for example, on minimising the amount of personal data and pseudonymising personal data 
as soon as possible’12. 
 
Privacy by Design for NHL Stenden is a design requirement for systems and processes and a 
precondition during procurement and tendering . 
 
Privacy by Design automatically precludes certain information or data, only selects relevant persons 
and data, removes (partial) information that is no longer required and deletes personal dat a as soon 
as it is no longer required13. 
 
Specific examples of privacy by design are :  
- A button ‘My details’  
- A good authorisation structure  
- The possibility to delete data automatically and in a differentiated manner (for example, at the 
end of the retention  period)  
- Possibility for detailed logging  
- The correct information on the correct screen (if for example the BSN number must  be used in 
the system, it is hidden deep and is only visible for those users for whom it must be visible)  
 
The DLWE service ensures  technical development of the design requirements which result from 
Privacy by Design and for an annual update thereof.  
 
The Purchasing department is responsible for including the requirement of privacy by design in the 
purchasing and tendering process.  
 
Within the Academy, Service or Liaison Unit the members of the DPC have a monitoring and informing 
role where it concerns the Privacy by Design . 
 
Each year, the DPO and the SO hold an information meeting about Privacy by Design.  
 
Privacy by Default (data pr otection through standard settings) is an associated concept: by default, the 
possibilities for choice must be set up in the most privacy -friendly manner. Within NHL Stenden, this is 
a point of attention within the Office365 environment.  
 
The DLWE service is responsible for the privacy -friendly set -up of the systems used within the 
university of applied sciences and for the information about them.  
10.5.  Controller -Processo r Agreement Procedure 14 
In accordance with Article 28 paragraph 3 of the GDPR, NHL Stenden enters into Controller -
Processo r Agreements with processors, parties which process personal data for us.

13 Taken from a presentation of Dr. Jaap -Henk Hoepman at Stenden University  of Applied Sciences  
on 15 February 2017.  
14 Mandating and procedure had not been  determined  yet at the time of submission of this plan.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   32 
The responsibility for entering into and the manag ement of the Controller -Processo r Agreements lies 
with the Purchasing department or, with contracts  under €50,000, with the budget holder.  
 
In principle, NHL Stenden applies the model agreement which has been developed by SURF. Small 
deviations, desired by the supplier, are submitted to the DPO for assessment. Substantial deviations 
are submitted to the  legal counsel on privacy of the Executiv e Staff. The Controller -Processo r 
Agreements are signed by the EB or, for contracts under €50,000, by the budget holder.  
 
Monitoring the compliance with the obligation t o enter into Controller -Processo r Agreements is part of 
the privacy audit which is carried out twice a year by the Executive Staff. This monitoring takes place 
on the basis of the overviews from the data registers.  
 
Each year, in cooperation with the legal counsel on privacy, the DPO organises an in formation s ession 
about Controller -Processo r Agreements.  
 
The Controller -Processo r Agreements are emphatically addressed in the report discussions of the 
director of Finance, Procurement & Control with the EB.  
 
10.6.  Increasing awareness  
The protection of person al data is included in information systems, which are designed according to 
requirements of Privacy by Design, in procedures and mechanisms such as described, for example, in 
the data registers, but primarily in human actions. If employees and other data s ubjects are 
insufficiently aware of the importance of privacy, then drawing up a privacy policy is fighting a losing 
battle.  
 
The awareness site http://datacare.nhlstenden.com  was launched in the run up to the merger. In the 
first half of 2018 the SO and the DPO have jointly given more than twenty workshops and information 
meetings. This is now included in the programme of the Professionalisation Academy. Training takes 
place o n three levels:  
- Open registration for both teaching and support staff  
- Training for teams  
- Training members of the Data Protection Council. This training will have an impact on  the 
Academies, Services and Liaison Units that they represent. An important task of the members 
of the DPC is to propagate the importance of and to provide information about the careful 
processing of personal data.  
 
Under the responsibility of HRM, a module ‘privacy and security in a data -driven society’ will be 
included in the managem ent development projects. Attention to the protection of personal data is pre -
eminently an issue to be discussed during the report meetings with all directors and the EB.  
 
At least once a month for the next two years, special attention will be paid to the topic of privacy.  
 
The awareness campaign focuses on all categories of data subjects, whereby the staff members and 
students will be addressed first.  
 
This campaign is supported by the Marketing and Communication service.  
 
 
10.7.  Privacy and internationalisation  
The privacy legislation imposes strict requirements on the transfer of personal data to countries 
outside the European Economic Area.  
  
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   33 
The GDPR applies to all European students and employees of NHL Stenden, wherever they may be. 
The G DPR also applies to students from outside the EEA, who are studying in the Netherlands, such 
as the so -called ’60 ECs students’.  
 
In accordance with Article 46, paragraph 2c, NHL Stenden bases the transfer of personal data to the 
countries in which our  International  Branch Campuses are located  on ‘appropriate safeguards’, in 
particular on the ‘standard data protection clauses adopted by the (European) Commission’. NHL 
Stenden has concluded these so -called model contracts or ‘model clauses’ with all four IBC s. This 
means that the transfer of personal data within the framework of the Grand TourTM has a legal basis15. 
 
The transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA within the framework of placements or 
exchanges is based on compliance with a contract  entered into in the interest of the data subject 
(Article 49, paragraph 1).  
 
The transfer of the data of registered international students to agents outside the EEA is based on the 
permission that the students in question have given for this purpose.  
 
Although the International Branch Campuses legally have their own responsibility and must comply 
with the legislation applicable to them, it stands to reason to handle personal data globally in the same 
way within the 'NHL Stenden Group', regardless of the  different responsibilities and the different legal 
regimes. NHL Stenden has a Privacy Guideline for this purpose, as an internal code of conduct with 
regard to processing personal data at the various locations and the transfer of personal data between 
the locations. (see appendix 10.9).  
 
The EB is responsible for compliance with the European model contracts. This responsibility has been 
mandated to the Director of International Affairs.  
 
The responsibility for compliance with the Privacy Guideline lies wi th the General Managers of the 
IBCs.  
 
The DPO monitors the alignment of the Privacy Guideline with the GDPR and promotes awareness at 
the International Branch Campuses.  
 
10.8.  Privacy and research  
A lot of research is done within an institute for higher educatio n, such as NHL Stenden. In many 
cases, personal data of the research subjects is processed in the context of such research. Because 
every research is different, the category of research subjects does not lend itself for a data register as 
set up for the ot her target groups. The SmartPIA tool is used to identify   the personal data processed 
within the framework of the various research projects.  
 
NHL Stenden will develop a privacy toolbox for research as soon as possible, using good examples 
from elsewhere.  
 
This toolbox should ideally contain the following tools.  
 A concise privacy protocol for the various types of researchers, from Bachelor students to PhD 
students.  
 An ethics committee, possibly in cooperation with one or more other educational institutions.  
 A safe tool, provided by NHL Stenden to perform online research.  
 A repository for research data, possibly in cooperation with one or more other educational 
institutions.  
 A platform for launching and participating in internal research among students and staff.  
 
                                                      
15 This is based on a detailed advice from among others Duthler Associates Transfer of personal data 
to third countries from 17 August 2017.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   34 
The responsibility for compliance with the privacy rules for research lies with the Director of R&D 
Education and Research.  
 
The development of the privacy toolbox has been assigned to the Research and Privacy committee 
specially set up for this pu rpose.  
 
10.9.  International Privacy guideline NHL Stenden  
 
Privacy guideline NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  
 
Purpose  
By issuing this guideline NHL Stenden shows how it acts in accordance with the legal 
requirements and protects the personal data of members of staff, students and third parties. 
The guideline describes the approach we take to privacy and is based on Dutch law.  
 
Scope  
The guideline covers the processing of all personal data by or on behalf of NHL Stenden  (all 
locations).  
 
Definitions  
Personal data : all data concerning an identified or identifiable natural person.  
  
Processing of personal data : all actio ns or series of actions related to personal data, 
including in all cases the collection, registration, classification, storage, editing, amendment, 
retrieval, viewing, usage, issue by means of forwarding, distribution or any other form of 
provision, unitin g, placing in mutual relation, as well as the protection, exchange or 
destruction of data.  
 
Controller : the natural person, legal person or any other person who or administrative body 
that, acting alone or in association with others, lays down the purpose  and the means of 
processing personal data.  
 
Processor : the person who processes the personal data for the controller, without being 
subject to the controller's direct authority.  
  
Data subject : the person to whom the personal data relates.  
 
Data protect ion officer (DPO): The position of the DPO is laid down by law. He oversees 
the processing of personal data and can make recommendations to improve how the 
personal data is processed.  
 
Data Protection Council : The Data Protection Council at NHL Stenden is  a consultative and 
advisory body with regard to policies on privacy (protection of personal data) and security 
(information security). The DPC is composed of representatives from all Academies, Liaison 
Units and departments. The members of the Information  Security Steering Group are 
officially part of the DPC. The members of the DPC are called Data Protection Counsellors.    
 
 
Privacy governance  
Data processing carried out by or on behalf of NHL Stenden is reported to the Data 
Protection Officer and published on the intranet.   
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   35 
The adopted NHL Stenden policy forms the framework for this. The key terms are 
transparency and purpose limitation. We say what we do and we do only what is necessary.  
Privacy issues are communicated via the privacy portal accessible via the Start Menu.   
 
How do we obtain the data?  
Data is only collected:  
- directly or indirectly (via Studielink, agents, social media) from the data subject through the 
channels provided for by law.  
 
What do we do with the data?  
Personal data is processed exclusively:  
- if necessary for education or research, in particular t o facilitate education for students;  
- if necessary for the purpose of the employer -employee relationship;  
- if it has been given to the DPO (stating the legal grounds);  
- if the data subject has given explicit consent for this to be done;  
- if the vit al interests of the data subject are at stake.  
 
What are our general principles?  
The personal data processed by NHL Stenden is correct and relevant and is legitimately and 
legally processed.  
NHL Stenden does not collect any more data than what is necess ary (data minimisation). 
Employees of NHL Stenden are asked to provide a copy of their passport when they join the 
organisation; on no occasions other than that.  
NHL Stenden does not keep data for longer than necessary. This is based on the Selection 
List for Universities of Applied Sciences ( Selectielijst hogescholen ).  
NHL Stenden collects data only for a precisely defined purpose that is related to the 
institution's social mandate (purpose limitation);  
NHL Stenden never passes on data to third parties unless:  
- it is legally obliged to do so;  
- the data subject has given explicit consent for this to be done.  
 
A supporting document or copy of the diploma is only issued to or on the request of the data 
subject, for example. Email details of students or  members of staff are issued to the research 
agencies for quality surveys (National Student Survey (NSE), staff satisfaction survey).  
To the extent that NHL Stenden has personal data processed by third parties (processors), a 
processor's agreement is ente red into with the processors laying down responsibility for data 
breaches.  
NHL Stenden never sells personal data and does not make it available for commercial 
purposes in any way whatsoever.  
NHL Stenden effectively protects the personal data in accordanc e with the current state of 
technology. Personal data is encrypted where necessary and possible.  
 
Special categories of personal data  
NHL Stenden does not process any special personal data other than  
- nationality (in connection with the internationalisation policy);  
- religion (exclusively for the Education in Primary Schools programme in connection with 
assigning the placements by denomination);  
- medical data (if necessary for assistance in the cont ext of the Study and Disability scheme 
and for the safety of students during the Grand Tour™.  
  
 
NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences  Privacy Policy Plan   36 
Forwarding of data to third countries  
NHL Stenden Netherlands does not exchange personal data with the international branch 
campuses unless:  
- this is necessa ry for educational purposes;  
- there is no alternative owing to the obligations under the employment contract;  
- the vital interests of the data subject are at stake.  
 
Rights and obligations of data subjects  
Data subjects have the right to view and cor rect their data. They can also object to the 
registration of certain data.  
For matters concerning the protection of their personal data they can lodge a complaint with 
the DPO. Students can also lodge a complaint via ELF (single point of contact facility) .  
All persons at NHL Stenden are obliged to report possible personal data protection breaches 
to the DPO (responsible disclosure).  
Managerial staff and members of the Data Protection Council  are obliged to report the 
processing of personal data to the DP O.  
 
To conclude  
If in doubt, the DPO should be consulted.  
The Data Protection Officer of NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences is Willem Bakker.
