Information security and privacy

In the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG), the University of the Arts (HdK) has listed all the necessary information about privacy on a special privacy website. Here everyone can delve into the way in which personal data is processed within the HdK.

The HdK board also considers it important that its staff and students know how to handle other people's personal details with care. This privacy website is also for them, to learn how to put good privacy behavior into daily practice.

Documents that are only accessible to employees or students refer to a closed intranet environment.
